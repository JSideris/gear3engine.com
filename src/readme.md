	- Lightning?
- Overview
	- Visual: Spinning planet.
	- "Built for web first."
		- Gear3Engine uses the latest cutting-edge technology available in modern web browsers. It is is designed for creating real-time MMOs, physics simulations, first-person shooters, top-down games, and more.
		- Turn single-player games into multiplayer games with minimal effort and zero code duplication. Games are fully simulated (including physics), frame by frame, on the server and all clients. The engine intelligently takes care of all game object concurrency. Selecting objects and fields to sync is done with a single line of code, and all data transmission is highly optimized.
- Plugin Architecture
	- Visual: Diagram of plugins.
	- "Modular architecture."
		- Gear3Engine offers full support for building 2D and 3D visuals and physics, as well as non-WebGL apps (such as trivia).
		- Isolated plugins make games light-weight by only packaging libraries needed for the game.
		- Plugins work together intelligently and communicate with each other using events. The plugin interface makes development a breeze!
- Featured plugin: AI
	- Visual: Chess pieces on an endless chessboard.
	- "Powerful AI out of the box."
		- Gear3Engine comes loaded with useful AI algorithms, including pathfinding, collision avoidance, and active learning.
		- The AI plugin works with the physics plugin to automatically build A* graphs for most simulations.
		- Custom behavior can be built using the included behavior tree API.
- Featured plugin: Controls
	- Visual: controller.
	- "Full gamepad support in your browser (try it!)."
		- The control plugin allows developers to specify configurable key and button bindings, with full gamepad support via the W3C Gamepad API.
		- Bindings are set with minimal hassle, and controls (from any source) are fed into any controllabe game object. Controllable objects can be controlled by mouse and keyboard, gamepads, AI, or over the network through the same interface.
- Featured example: medical imaging.
	- Visual: 3D head.
	- "Build more than games."
		- Gear3Engine "gamifies" the development of advanced interactive web applications. It's approach to rendering, object lifecycle management, interconnectivity, and data syncronization allows you to easily develop next-generation websites.
